# Aligned Delegate Roster — Change History

Atlas path: `A.1.5.1.5` — List of Recognized Aligned Delegates (Core), with
the Active Data table at `A.1.5.1.5.0.6.1`. Mutates whenever an AD is
formally recognized, derecognized, or has identifying data updated (e.g.
contract migrations).

Roster changes have historically arrived as Flow 1 (weekly Atlas Edit
Proposals); going forward, equivalent registry-only updates may also arrive
as Flow 3 (Active Data Direct Edit) at the Core Facilitator's discretion.

Framework PRs that touched the AD roster as part of larger structural
changes (e.g. PR #186 renumbering `A.1.5.1.4` → `A.1.5.1.5` to make room for
the Probationary Period) remain in the parent `../changelog.md`.

## PR #173 — derecognize Sky Staking
**Merged:** 2026-01-27 | **Type:** Active Data update (Core Facilitator)

### Material Changes
- **AD derecognized**: Sky Staking — removed from the Recognized Aligned Delegates table and added to the Derecognized Alignment Conservers registry (`A.1.4.10.2.0.6.1`) dated 2026-01-27, reason **misalignment**. Forum: https://forum.sky.money/t/ad-derecognition-due-to-misalignment-2026-01-27/27655

### Context
Sky Staking was recognized as an AD in PR #6 (2025-06-16) and derecognized here ~7 months later. Unlike the 2023–2024 derecognitions (operational-security breaches / failure to migrate), this one is logged as a misalignment derecognition.
